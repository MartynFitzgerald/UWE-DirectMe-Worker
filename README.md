# DirectMe - Worker

The focus behind this final year computing project is to make parking easier, and dynamic for the user. The idea works by using the external data that will be displayed in our application programming interface (API) which will be combined with the userâ€™s information that has been specified previously in the application. This information will then be inserted into an algorithm that will determine what is the best location to park their vehicle within a radius of the postcode, geo-location, or street name given.
